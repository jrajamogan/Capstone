General Assembly - Data Science Immersive - Capstone Project - Autumn 2019

This is my capstone project for General Assembly.

Please note I am currently in the middle of making a major update to the project to make it much more user friendly to read.

Please click on the JR_CAPSTONE_House_Price_Crime_Gentrification.ipynb file to view the project. If it fails to load please retry, sometimes it takes a few tries. I am working on a fix for this.
